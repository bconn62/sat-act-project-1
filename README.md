# sat-act-project-1
SAT/ACT participation 


This is project #1 of the GA data science immersive course, focusing on analyzing participation rates of the SAT and ACT tests at the state level. The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with exploratory data analysis and basic statistical analysis, as well as practice using the Pandas library. 


Prompt: "For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams. Your presentation should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams."
